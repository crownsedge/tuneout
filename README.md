# TuneOut

TuneOut is an AppleScript application that saves the currently playing iTunes or Spotify track's information to a file (~/Library/Application Support/TuneOut/np.txt, specifically). This might be useful if you use an application like OBS to stream live video and want to incorporate your currently playing song on the display.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This branch contains a new rewrite of TuneOut using AppleScriptObjC. The current commit is essentially only a proof of concept, which will be expounded on significantly soon. For now you are much better off using the existing version on the releases page.

## Thanks

To [dzomb](https://github.com/dzomb) who wrote the [original version](https://github.com/dzomb/tuneout) of this script and to [wildgift](http://twitch.tv/wildgifticus) for getting me to write this.

Additional thanks to [Christopher T. Howlett](http://howlettstudios.com) for the royalty-free tuning fork shape used in our icon.
