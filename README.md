# TuneOut

TuneOut is an AppleScript application that saves the currently playing iTunes, Spotify, Nightbot or Moobot track's information to a file (~/Library/Application Support/TuneOut/np.txt, specifically). This might be useful if you use an application like OBS to stream live video and want to incorporate your currently playing song on the display.

## How to use

1. Download the latest version of TuneOut.app from the project's [releases](http://github.com/wonaldson/tuneout/releases) page and unzip the file.
2. Double-click the .app file. (Depending on your Gatekeeper settings, you may have to right-click the .app file and click "Open".)
3. Point your OBS text-as-file location to `~/Library/Application Support/TuneOut/np.txt`, where `~` consists of your User folder (usually `/Users/{your user name here}`).
4. For iTunes cover art support, point your OBS image location to `~/Library/Application Support/TuneOut/art.png`.
5. There is no step five!

## How to build

1. Clone the repository to your macOS computer.
2. In `build.command`, replace the code signing identity with your own.
3. In the repository directory, make `build.command` executable: `chmod +x build.command`
4. Double-click `build.command` in Finder or run it in the terminal: `./build.command`

TuneOut.app will be built in `./build/` (where `.` is the repository folder) and a .zip file with the version number will be created.

## Caveats

If you play songs with non-latin characters, make sure your font supports them. The font renderer used by OBS does not fall back to fonts where the glyphs needed appears like macOS font rendering typically does.

Support for web players such as Nightbot and Moobot only functions when running in Safari or Google Chrome.

To enable Safari support, you must enable "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" in Safari's Develop menu. If you do not have a Develop menu, it can be enabled in the Advanced section of Safari's Preferences.
